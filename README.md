> This project has evolved and is now succeeded by [**JARVISv4**](https://github.com/bentman/JARVISv4)


JARVISv3 is a local-first AI assistant designed for daily workflows on your machines. It's built on a **Workflow Graph** architecture, which means instead of just chatting, it coordinates specialized agents to handle things like search, deep research, code creation, code review, and memory retrieval — all while running on your own hardware.

**Development Status**: All backend roadmap phases completed. See CHANGE_ROADMAP.md for the complete development history and CHANGE_LOG.md for implementation details.

## 🔍 Reality Check: What works?

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Chat** | ⚠️ Implemented | Requires external LLM provider (Ollama/llama.cpp). |
| **Voice Interaction**| ⚠️ Implemented | Wake word and STT/TTS implemented but require external voice models. |
| **Memory** | ✅ Exercised | Semantic search across past conversations (FAISS) - locally functional. |
| **Web Research** | ⚠️ Implemented | Aggregated search with privacy redaction. Requires external search APIs. |
| **Multi-Machine** | ⚠️ Implemented | Runs on Win/Mac/Linux with distributed node support. |
| **Daily Utility** | ⚠️ Implemented | System integration available but requires configuration. |

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 🖥️ Desktop (with NVIDIA GPU)
Use Docker for the easiest setup with GPU acceleration:
1.  **Configure**: `cp .env.example .env` (Add API keys for web search if needed).
2.  **Build**: `make docker-build`
3.  **Launch**: `make docker-up`
4.  **Access**: UI at `http://localhost:3000`, API at `http://localhost:8000`.
5.  **Monitor**: `make docker-logs`

### 💻 Laptop (Mac M-Series or NPU)
Run natively for best performance and NPU access:
1.  **Setup**: `make setup` (creates venv and installs dependencies)
2.  **Validate**: `make validate` (runs comprehensive test suite)
3.  **Backend**: `make backend-dev` (in another terminal)
4.  **Frontend**: `make frontend-dev` (in another terminal)
5.  **Access**: UI at `http://localhost:3000`, API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 📦 External Dependencies (Optional)

### Voice Services
For full voice functionality, download these external dependencies:

**Whisper STT:**
```bash
# Download from official Whisper.cpp repository
# Place ggml-base.en.bin model in ./models/ directory
```

**Piper TTS:**
```bash
# Download from official Piper repository  
# Place voice models in ./models/ directory
```

**OpenWakeWord:**
```bash
pip install openwakeword
```

### Search APIs
For web search functionality, set these environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
# Bing Search (recommended)
SEARCH_BING_API_KEY=your_bing_api_key

# Google Custom Search
SEARCH_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
SEARCH_GOOGLE_CX=your_google_cx

# Tavily Search
SEARCH_TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

### Local Models
For local AI inference without external APIs, download GGUF models to `./models/`:
- Llama-3.2-1B/3B/8B models
- CodeLlama models for coding tasks

*All voice and search features work without these dependencies but will use fallback modes.*

---

## 🛠️ Daily Workflows

*   **Search**: Grab results from the web without the tracking.
*   **Deep Research**: Dig deep into a topic and get a clean summary.
*   **Code Creation**: Spin up logic locally—your code stays on your drive.
*   **Code Review**: Catch bugs and style issues before you commit.
*   **Memory Retrieval**: "What was that idea I had last Tuesday?"

### Voice Mode

#### Wake Word Activation

JARVISv3 supports hands-free activation using wake word detection:

1. **Default Wake Word**: "Jarvis" (configurable in Settings)
2. **Activation**: Say the wake word followed by your command
3. **Feedback**: Visual and audio feedback confirms activation

#### Voice Commands

##### Basic Commands
```
"Jarvis, what's the weather?"
"Jarvis, set a reminder for tomorrow"
"Jarvis, search for information about AI"
```

##### Advanced Commands
```
"Jarvis, start a research task about renewable energy"
"Jarvis, create a workflow for code review"
"Jarvis, search my memory for project notes"
```

### Text Mode
